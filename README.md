# Advent of Code 2025

These are my solutions for Advent of Code 2025!

This year, my aim is to practice using Python some more. It's a language I've been very interested in for a while and I think this will be a great opportunity. :)

Last year, I tackled the challenges in C# and made it up to Day 16, something I'm pretty pleased with. You can find my previous solutions [here](https://github.com/robeecodes/advent-of-code-2024).

Happy Coding! 🎄🎄🎄
